											Hello everyone, I Dr. Suresh R Parekar would like to express my views on स्वयंसिद्ध Hackathon 2020 a 
											social technical hackathon organised by AISSMS COE along with Unnat Bharat Abhiyan.To begin with 
											I would like to say a few words on one of the basic need of a man i.e. Food which is affected directly 
											by farming. Now a days we are all aware that the food we get is not that healthy or organic in 
											sofesticated words. So what can be done? Asking this question would be very outdated, as we all 
											know that this problem has got an excellent solution which we call Organic Farming but again many 
											of the farmer's are still unaware of this healthy farming. The another issue that takes a stand is
											water management and energy resources. Many of the farmers and villages are still deprived of these 
											facilities while many villages are emerging. Because of lack of basic amenities and infrastructure,
											the education and training are hampered to some extent. Artisan, Industries and livelihood are 
											developing at a greater pace. While considering all this, we somewhere have to start encouraging 
											women and work on Women empowerment. There are many such things and points to be concerned for the 
											developing India. AISSMS COE is giving you an opportunity to beat your brains out and think on the
											above topics and give a convenient and economic solution. We invite you to take part in this and 
											suggest your ideas. Welcome one welcome all..!!
